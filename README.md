# Iramirez108.week.01
In order to make the code more readable. I applied semantic elemnts in a number of areas. 
To start I added the <header> in the 10th line and closed the </header> in the 31st line.
There were three sections in the code starting with putting <section> on the 35th line and closing it on the 45th line.
In the section there were pictures so I added <figure> on line 49 and closed it on line 51. Figure was added because  I wanted to specify a self conatined photo 
This is also the same for the next <section> and <figure> that I added. 
<section> was added on line 47 and close on the 57th line as well on the 59th line and 70th line and <figure> was added on the 49th line and closed on the 51st line as wel on the 61st line and closed on the 63rd line. 
Then I added an <aside> on the 75th line and closed on the 81st line. I added them to all three asides of the webpage since they were all part of the aside section on the webpage.
<aside> on line 84th and 90th as well on 93 and 99
<Footer> is the last on I added on line 103 and closed on 110. Since there was a copyright information a footer was need.
